# Ayu One Dark Pro

> Color Theme for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Combination of [Ayu](https://github.com/ayu-theme/vscode-ayu) and [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) with a few edits for myself.

Includes the four dark Ayu workbench themes:

- Mirage
- Mirage Bordered
- Dark
- Dark Bordered

I personally use **Mirage Bordered**.  
Not too dark, with slight contextual borders ðŸ‘Œ

The syntax highlighting is One Dark Pro **Bold**.  
So, **methods()** are bold, and I've change javascript object keys to be aqua instead of red.  
There was way too much red.

Bye.

Release checklist because I forget things:
