# Dotfiles

A tidy `$HOME` is a tidy mind.

This repository consists of configuration for any tools I use within my [Arch Linux][arch] and [neovim][] development environment.
I use a *lot* of tools which culminate in a sort of Unix IDE,
I use [stow][] to link all of the required configuration into my home directory.

## Quick start
This quick start will show you how to quickly clone this repo and install all dots to your home.
I usually keep my dotfiles in `/home/<USER>/.dotfiles`

### Install GNU/stow
> If planning to use stow to manage the (symlinked) dots

Your distribution repositories is very likely to contain `stow`, for example in Arch Linux, all you have to do to install it is:
`sudo pacman -S stow`
or on Ubuntu/Debian you can install stow by executing:
`apt install stow`
####
### Clone
- Clone this repo to your dots directory on your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/folws/dotfiles <DOTS_DIR>`
### Setup
- If you want more syntax highlighting, format your code like this:

## Configs

### Anne Pro 2
Holds the light and keymap profiles for my anne pro keyboard

### Bin
Holds global and useful helper scripts required by most dots.

### Firefox
##### userChrome
Based upon [mut-ex]'s minimal-functional-firefox but cleaned up and aware of colors generated by pywal in `.Xresources`. Also added is an auto hiding tabbar with reduced tab sizes to have a more minimal UI.

##### Startpage
Modified version of KorySchneider's tab [Github][tab].

#### Polybar

My config is a modified Polybar-4 by adi1090x. - [GitHub][adi1090x]
