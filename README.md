This repository consists of configuration for any tools I use within my [Arch Linux][arch] and [neovim][] development environment.
I use a *lot* of tools which culminate in a sort of Unix IDE,
I use [dotdrop] to install link all of the required configuration into my home directory.

## Requirements

### GNU/stow
> If planning to use stow to manage the (symlinked) dots

Your distribution repositories is very likely to contain `stow`, for example in Arch Linux, all you have to do to install it is:
`sudo pacman -S stow`
or on Ubuntu/Debian you can install stow by executing:
`apt install stow`

## Rice-insallation

### Install & Update Script
To **install** or **update** configs on your system, you should run the [install_script][]. To do that, you may either download and run the script manually, or use the following cURL or Wget command:
```sh
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/folws/dotfiles/master/bootstrap | bash
```

```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/folws/dotfiles/master/bootstrap | bash
```

## Dots (WIP)

### Anne Pro 2
Holds the light profiles and keymaps for my Anne pro keyboard

### Firefox
A browser where being fast is not an understatement

#### userChrome
Based upon [mut-ex]'s minimal-functional-firefox but cleaned up and aware of colors generated by pywal in `.Xresources`. Also added is an auto hiding tabbar with reduced tab sizes to have a more minimal UI.

##### Startpage
Modified version of KorySchneider's tab [Github][tab].

#### Polybar
My config is a modified Polybar-4 by adi1090x. - [GitHub][adi1090x]

### Neovim
No editor is as extensible, easy to use as Vim is. But standard Vim ... TODO

#### Keymaps
Using the (`ctrl/shift`) + `enter`keybinds in term vim requires special keycodes that vim expects to be sent by your terminal.
Depending on your terminal,

[iTerm2]
For a single Profile open Preferences → Profiles → Keys → [+] (Add)
For all profiles open Preferences → Keys → [+] (Add)
  - Keyboard shortcut: (Hit Shift+Enter)
  - Action: Send Escape Sequence
  - Esc+ ``[13;2u``
  - Repeat for Ctrl+Enter, with sequence: ``[13;5u``

[urxvt], append to your .Xresources file:
```Xresources
URxvt.keysym.S-Return:     \033[13;2u
URxvt.keysym.C-Return:     \033[13;5u
```

[Alacritty], under key_bindings, add following to your ~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml:
```yaml
- { key: Return,   mods: Shift,   chars: "\x1b[13;2u" }
- { key: Return,   mods: Control, chars: "\x1b[13;5u" }
```

Kitty, in ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf:
```conf
map shift+enter send_text all \x1b[13;2u
map ctrl+enter send_text all \x1b[13;5u
```
